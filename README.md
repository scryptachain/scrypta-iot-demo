# Scrypta IoT demo application

Use this application to create an history temperature graph using the blockchain.

This script fetches and saves the informations every 1 minute, so you need 1.44 LYRA each day.

Use simple with:
```node index.js```

Or if you want to create a persistent script using PM2:
```pm2 start index.js```
